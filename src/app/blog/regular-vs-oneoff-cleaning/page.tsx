      question: "What do cleaners charge per hour in Melbourne?",
      answer: "Most professional cleaners in Melbourne charge between $35-40 per hour. You might find private cleaners for $25-60/hr, but the quality varies a lot. Agencies often charge $45-80/hr due to higher overhead costs. We stick to $35-40/hr because it gives you the best balance of quality and value."
    },
    {
      question: "How much should I expect to pay for a 2-hour clean?",
      answer: "A 2-hour professional clean typically costs around $70-80. This usually covers your main living areas like the kitchen, bathrooms, and living room. Most cleaning services require at least 2 hours to do a proper job‚Äîanything less and you&apos;re probably not getting a thorough clean."
    },
    {
      question: "What can a cleaner realistically do in 3 hours?",
      answer: "In 3 hours, a good cleaner can handle a 2-3 bedroom apartment or small house pretty thoroughly. They&apos;ll clean the kitchen, bathrooms, living areas, and bedrooms‚Äîdusting, vacuuming, mopping, and sanitizing the main surfaces. It&apos;s enough time to make a real difference without rushing."
    },
    {
      question: "What&apos;s the cheapest you can pay for a cleaner?",
      answer: "You can find cleaners starting at around $25-30 per hour, but honestly, you get what you pay for. Quality professional cleaning usually costs $35-40/hr because that covers proper equipment, insurance, trained staff, and good cleaning products. Going too cheap often means cutting corners."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does house cleaning actually cost in Melbourne?",
      answer: "Here&apos;s the breakdown: regular cleaning runs $35-40/hr, a 2-hour clean costs $70-80, deep cleaning is $160-300, and end-of-lease cleaning starts at $250-450. The good news is you can keep weekly cleaning under $100 if you&apos;re smart about which areas to focus on."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I go with regular cleaning or just one-off deep cleans?",
      answer: "It depends on your situation, but here&apos;s what we&apos;ve found works best: start with a deep clean to get your home to a good baseline, then switch to regular weekly or fortnightly cleaning to maintain it. Regular cleaning is better for long-term maintenance, while one-off cleans are perfect for resets or special occasions."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I get my house professionally cleaned?",
      answer: "Most Melbourne homes do well with weekly cleaning for the high-traffic areas (kitchen, bathrooms, living rooms) and fortnightly cleaning for bedrooms and less-used spaces. This approach keeps your costs manageable while maintaining good hygiene standards throughout your home."

              Here&apos;s the reality most Melbourne homeowners don&apos;t want to hear: if your home hasn&apos;t had professional cleaning in months (or years), you&apos;re not just dealing with surface dust. You&apos;re facing hidden grime, built-up grease, and allergens that regular cleaning won&apos;t touch.

            <p style={{ marginBottom: "24px" }}>
              As cleaning specialists who&apos;ve seen hundreds of Melbourne homes, we always recommend starting with a one-off deep clean‚Äîespecially if you&apos;ve never used professional cleaners. Here&apos;s why:
