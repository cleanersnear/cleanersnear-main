Agencies often charge $45-80/hr due to higher overhead costs. We stick to $35-40/hr because it gives you the best balance of quality and value."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "A 2-hour professional clean typically costs around $70-80. This usually covers your main living areas like the kitchen, bathrooms, and living room. Most cleaning services require at least 2 hours to do a proper job—anything less and you're probably not getting a thorough clean."

        "@type": "Answer", 
        "text": "In 3 hours, a good cleaner can handle a 2-3 bedroom apartment or small house pretty thoroughly. They'll clean the kitchen, bathrooms, living areas, and bedrooms—dusting, vacuuming, mopping, and sanitizing the main surfaces. It's enough time to make a real difference without rushing."

Quality professional cleaning usually costs $35-40/hr because that covers proper equipment, insurance, trained staff, and good cleaning products. Going too cheap often means cutting corners."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It depends on your situation, but here's what we've found works best: start with a deep clean to get your home to a good baseline, then switch to regular weekly or fortnightly cleaning to maintain it. Regular cleaning is better for long-term maintenance, while one-off cleans are perfect for resets or special occasions."
